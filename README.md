The number of accidents are increasing in large numbers. The lifesaving vehicles like ambulances are seen stuck in traffic and many have lost life because the patients could not make it to hospital on time. This is partially because vehicles are independently controlled, for example any accidents happen in highways then that would create road blockage and heavy traffic and as there is no mechanism to gather and process traffic information and provide warnings, so in order to improvise the traffic conditions VANET is used.

Objectives

• To implement existing VANETS clustering routing protocol.

• To enhance the performance of clustering routing protocol with respect to throughput, delay, PDR & overhead.

• Performance comparison of existing and enhanced clustering protocols.

• To implement the security parameter.
